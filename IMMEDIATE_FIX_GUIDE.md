## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table already exists" warnings
**Solution**: This is normal - the script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` to safely handle existing tables.

### Issue: Still getting conversation creation errors
**Possible causes**:
1. Migration script didn't run completely
2. User doesn't have proper tenant relationship
3. RLS policies are blocking access

**Debug steps**:
1. Check if tables exist: `SELECT * FROM public.conversations LIMIT 1;`
2. Check user relationships: `SELECT * FROM public.tenant_users;`
3. Re-run the migration script (it's safe to run multiple times)

### Issue: Login doesn't work
**Solution**: The migration creates test users. If you have existing auth setup, use your existing credentials but ensure the user has proper tenant relationships.
